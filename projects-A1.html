                This project originated from a roleplay and collaborative storytelling community with friends and other developers who participated in their spare time. 
                In this community, I played the role of a Han dynasty-esque empire which required me to model assets and write entire story arcs, pushing my skills in writing and modelling to the absolute limit.

                This project started mostly as a friendly competition between a group of developers for a flightsim.
                Each developer would try to outdo the other in terms of how "cool" of a jet they could make to be imported and added to the game. Though I always lost to those who exclusively used blender, I gained many skills in CSG modelling and visual design.
